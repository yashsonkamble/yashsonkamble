## üßë‚Äçüíª About Me  

I recently earned my **Master‚Äôs in Computer Science** from the **University at Buffalo**, building on a solid foundation from my Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science. I‚Äôve always been fascinated by the way technology can turn ideas into reality, and I‚Äôm passionate about creating **efficient, scalable, and impactful software** that solves real-world problems.  

Throughout my academic journey ‚Äî both in my Bachelor‚Äôs and Master‚Äôs ‚Äî I immersed myself in diverse projects that challenged me to explore multiple domains of computer science. I:  

- Built a **custom relational database system** from scratch  
- Developed **real-time computer vision applications**  
- Created **automation bots** with Selenium  
- Implemented core **operating system features** like memory and process management  
- Designed and deployed a **real-time text chat application** using networking concepts  
- Applied **machine learning**, **neural networks**, and **reinforcement learning** to practical use cases  
- Built a fully functional **8-bit microprocessor** from the ground up, gaining a deep understanding of how hardware and software integrate  
- Developed **web applications** and a **restaurant management system** using full-stack technologies  

These experiences went beyond assignments and projects ‚Äî they strengthened my skills in low-level design, data structures and algorithms, operating systems, and computer networks. They also enhanced my critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration abilities, preparing me to work effectively both independently and within diverse teams. Along the way, I became proficient in technologies like Python, C++, Flask, React, AWS, Selenium, and many more, while mastering the art of balancing technical trade-offs, debugging complex systems, and delivering robust, scalable solutions.

Outside of tech, I like to keep things balanced. I‚Äôm an avid **cricket player and fan**, I enjoy **FPS and story-driven video games** (with **CS2** being my go-to), and I‚Äôm committed to **training regularly** to stay active and healthy.  

For me, software engineering isn‚Äôt just a profession it‚Äôs a craft I enjoy refining every day. Whether I‚Äôm building something from scratch or improving an existing system, I approach every project with curiosity, precision, and the drive to make it better than before.
